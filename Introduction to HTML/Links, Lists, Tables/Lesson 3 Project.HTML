<h2> Research Question</h1>
<p> What are the effects of different types and amounts of caffeinated beverages, such as energy drinks and canned coffee, on students' resting heart rate and heart rate variability?
</p>

<p> Teenagers are increasingly consuming caffeine and energy drinks, which are accessible to all age groups, including children. Research indicates rising caffeine consumption among adolescents, showing mixed effects such as improved attention but also increased fatigue, anxiety, and withdrawal symptoms, including difficulty concentrating and agitation. With over 83% of adolescents consuming caffeinated beverages regularly, this sparked curiosity about caffeine's impact on resting heart rate and heart rate variability, particularly in the 16-19 age group. Drawing from personal experiences and observations, the hypothesis suggests that increased caffeine intake elevates resting heart rate, with energy drinks potentially having a greater impact than canned coffee. A null hypothesis assumes no significant difference between the two. The study aims to explore these effects through targeted experiments on adolescents.
