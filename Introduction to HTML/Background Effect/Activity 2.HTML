            The evil eye is a widespread belief that a jealous or harmful gaze can cause misfortune, illness, or bad luck to someone, often unintentionally. It is common in cultures across the Middle East, South Asia, the Mediterranean, and Latin America. To protect against its effects, people use talismans like the Nazar, an eye-shaped charm, or perform rituals such as prayers or cleansing ceremonies. The belief reflects deep cultural concerns about envy and the power of negative energy, along with spiritual practices to guard against harm. </p>
