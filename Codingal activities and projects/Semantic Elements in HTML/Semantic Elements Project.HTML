        <ol> 
            <li><b> Reserve Pasta Water:</b> Don't skip this step! The starchy water helps the sauce cling to the pasta and balances the texture.  </li>
            <li><b> Control the Spice: </b> Start with a small amount of red chili flakes and taste as you go. You can always add more, but you can't take it out. </li>
            <li><b> Use High-Quality Ingredients:</b> Opt for good tomato paste, Parmesan, and fresh garlic for the best flavor.
            </li>
            <li><b> Skip Vodka if Needed:</b> It enhances the flavor but isn't essential. You can substitute it with water or more cream.
            </li>
        </ol>
