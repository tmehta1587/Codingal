            <h2> Importance of Global Warming </h2>

        <p> Global warming is the gradual increase in Earth's temperature caused by activities like burning fuels, cutting down trees, and releasing harmful gases to the air. It leads to problems like hotter weather, melting ice, rising sea levels, and stronger storms. These changes harm animals, plants, and people, making it harder to live safely and grow food. Tackling global warming is important to protect nature, keep our planet healthy, and ensure a safe future for everyone.   </p>
