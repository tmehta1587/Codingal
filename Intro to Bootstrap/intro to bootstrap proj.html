            <div class="bg-dark text-white p-3">My Hobbies! </div>
            <p> Cooking is my favorite hobby because it lets me be creative and relax. I love experimenting with recipes and sharing delicious meals with my family and friends. It brings me a sense of accomplishment and I love cafe hopping with my friends because it's a fun way to explore new places and try different foods and drinks. Ech cafe has its own unique vibes. My friends and I enjoy tasting new coffees, desserts and snacks. It is a fun way to relax and make memories together! </p>
